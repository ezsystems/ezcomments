 Quick manual
 =================
 1) Create a content with commenting feature
     - Create a class (in 'Setup' tab->'Classes'), 'article_comment' for instance
     - Create a content with class 'article_comment'
     - View the content in front end
     
 2) Set permission for reading, posting
    After 1) by default only administrator can post comment, for non-administrator users, we need to set permission.
    - Go to 'Roles and policies' (from 'Setup' tab->'Roles and policies' or 'User accounts'->'Roles and policies')
    - Click one role name, 'Anonymous' for instance, then edit the role by click 'Edit' button
    - Add one policy with module 'comment' and function 'read' by these steps:
      - Click 'New policy'
      - Select 'comment' from module list in step one
      - Click 'Grant access to one function'
      - Select 'read' in the function list
      - Click 'Grant full access' 
      - Click 'OK' button in the policy wizard page
      - Click 'OK' button in Edit Role page
    - Add one policy with module 'comment' and function 'add', which is similar to function 'read' (only difference is selecting 'add' in the function list).
    
 3) Post comment in the content view page as in 1)
